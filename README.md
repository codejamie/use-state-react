# JS Bootcamp Week 5, Day 1

## Activity 1: useState

This activity is designed to help you understand React's useState hook.

You should create an h1 or h2 element to initially display the number zero. This should be stored in state as a 'count' variable.

Create two buttons '+' and '-'. The buttons should increment and decrement respectively the count variable.
